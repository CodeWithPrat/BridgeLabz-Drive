### Write a program which converts each character of an input string as an ASCII value and stores each of these numbers in an array. Print that array
# ASCII Values of Characters in a String

This Java program converts each character of an input string into its corresponding ASCII value and stores these values in an array. It then prints the array containing the ASCII values of the characters.

## Program Overview

The program performs the following steps:

1. **Input String**:
   - It prompts the user to input a string.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - It initializes an array named `asciiArray` to store the ASCII values of characters from the input string.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - Using a `for` loop, it iterates through each character of the input string.
   - Inside the loop, it retrieves the ASCII value of each character using `(int) currentChar` and stores it in the `asciiArray` at the corresponding index.

4. **Printing ASCII Values**:
   - After storing all ASCII values in the array, it prints the array elements containing the ASCII values of each character in the input string.

## Running the Program

To execute the program:
- Compile the `ASCIICodeArray.java` file.
- Run the compiled Java class.
- Enter a string when prompted.
- The program will calculate and display the array containing the ASCII values of each character in the input string.

This program helps users to convert each character of a string into its ASCII value and demonstrates storing these values in an array for further use.
